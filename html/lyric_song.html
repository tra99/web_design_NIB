        Georgia, wrap me up in all your
        I want you in my arms
        Oh, let me hold you
        I'll never let you go again like I did
        Oh, I used to say
        I would never fall in love again until I found her
        I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
        I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
        I found you
        Georgia, pulled me in, I asked to
        Love her once again
        You fell, I caught you
        I'll never let you go again like I did
        Oh, I used to say
        I would never fall in love again until I found her
        I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
        I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
        I found you
        I would never fall in love again until I found her
        I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
        I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
        I found you
